# stayboogyUP PS3 MW3 Solo Survival Hacks -- SPRX and RTM for CEX CFW

#stayboogyUP MW3 Solo Survival SPRX for CEX CFW

This thing does everything the RTM Tool does, but without any user interaction.

All the hacks happen on a revolving schedule so they are always active without the player having to hit a button or open a menu.

God Mode is not activated in the SPRX.  If you require God Mode, then use the RTM Tool.
