# RTM

--Download:  

https://github.com/stayboogy/stayboogyUP_PS3-MW3-Solo-Survival-Hacks/releases/tag/stayboogyUP-22.11.25.rtm.sprx

--Requirements: 

CEX CFW 4.88 Cobra Mode On (Use EVILNAT, all others are garbage) CCAPI 2.80_r9 installed to PC and PS3

--Install:  

extract the zip, run CCAPI-install.cmd (this only installs the proper dll for my tool)

--How to Use:  

make sure Computer and PS3 are connected to same network
make sure you have connected with CCAPI Console and given your PS3 a name and verifed it works at least once before this
make sure MW3 is running already--absolutely necessary
click "Connect + Attach" and choose your ps3 which should be in the popup list

--stayboogyUP:  

All Perks, Primary Ammo(*), Secondary Ammo + No Reload(*), Grenades(*), Flashbangs(*), Claymores(*), C4(*)

--God Mode:  

The ONLY WORKING GOD MODE IN SURVIVAL SOLO(**)

(*) must own to get ammo for it; don't have anything in LEFT OR RIGHT DPAD (activate before getting sentry or air support with at least some of each item to see it work best)--will change when your configuration changes, ie. picking up a weapon or buying ammo which there is no need for

(**) works best without self-revive and without body armor; buy body armor and self-revive after activating this cheat for best results;
still depletes over time but takes a very long time to do so; can't guarantee it's effectiveness with body armor and self-revive, but without works better than any other such mod available

--Custom Memory Hack:  input your custom offset and bytes information here--can be used with any game as long as you connect + attach after the game is running
